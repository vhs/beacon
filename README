VHS Beacon

This repository contains the source code and design of the 
VHS ROBOMONTH!!!! Beacon.

Each beacon will act as a "capture point" that will express
in one of 3 states - Neutral, Red, or Blue.

The beacon will indicate it's state using a multicolour LED
and via an infrared pulse.

The beacon can be captured by sending an infrared pulse upwards
from underneath the beacon.

See ir.cpp for details on the Infrared Protocol and example 
implementation.

See RULES.txt for the official contest rules and regulations..
