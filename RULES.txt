VHS ROBOMONTH!!!!! CHALLENGE

== Overview - Beacon Capture Challenge! ==
We will conduct a series of challenges where robobots can compete solo and collaboratively to capture a set of one or more beacons within a gameplay arena.

The arena WILL:
* be on a wood floor relatively free of obstacles
* be approximately 5 metres by 5 meters

The arena MAY:
* be physically bounded

The beacon WILL:
* Have one of three states:
** Neutral - a beacon that is not yet captured
** Red - a beacon that has been captured by the Red Team
** Blue - a beacon that has been  captured by the Blue Team
* Communicate it's state using the IR PROTOCOL
* Watch for capture messages sent from robots using the IR PROTOCOL
* Maintain a counter for each team representing that team's score

The robot MUST:
* have a switch (hardware or software) to set to either RED team or BLUE team
* have RED and BLUE illumination to indicate their team
* be no taller than 15 centimetres
* be capable of communicating using the IR PROTOCOL

The robot MAY:
* detect IR messages of the beacons using the IR PROTOCOL

The robot MUST NOT:
* Knock the beacon over.

The teams MUST:
* share their codes on github
* have fun

The IR PROTOCOL is defined in ir.cpp.

Refer to the physical beacon for exact implementation details. Where these rules conflict with the physical beacon, the beacon shall be considered correct.
